## 🔥 How It Works

1. **Terraform** provisions VPC, EKS cluster, RDS DB, EC2 Bastion hosts.
2. **Ansible** configures the EC2 instances (Docker, security, Kubernetes CLI).
3. **Jenkins** pipeline builds the app, scans it with SonarQube, builds Docker images, and pushes them to AWS ECR.
4. **ArgoCD** pulls Helm charts from GitHub and deploys them automatically into EKS.
5. **Monitoring** stack collects metrics and visualizes health using Prometheus and Grafana.
